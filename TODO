== actually do==

actually use it. playon competitor? LOL
  auto skype recorder :)
  can use the default record device in...XP
  ffmpeg to record? if it's much more efficient I guess...so maybe I should do the upconverter first so that I understand it better...

slander the "add it to the offset" (might be null),also slander the "must be monotonically increasing"

tell msdn when... it calls discontinuity exactly [and fix my logic]

make it installerable etc :P

  check...if it's not threaded, do I have discontinuity messages on it?

silence should look like it works...

advertise/create sourceforge project for popular

== meh ==
audio timestamps should "be monotonous" as long as there's no discontinuity (todo: understand discontinuity better first)

higher quality, like more than 2 track [possible?]

generate the right amount of silence: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6362458/generating-silent-audio-track we might be ok here tho...

advertise to mauritius, VLC forum, mine...

test if I actually need threads or not...if not...why...remove them :)

blog posts that make it...um...match google searches that are high for it.
  advertise as a competitor to that other fella :P
  
work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?
