== actually do==

actually use it. playon competitor? LOL
  auto skype recorder :)
  can use the default record device in...XP
  ffmpeg to record? if it's much more efficient I guess...so maybe I should do the upconverter first so that I understand it better...

slander the "must be monotonically increasing"

tell msdn when... it calls discontinuity exactly [and fix my logic]

double check...if it's not threaded, do I have more discontinuity messages on it?

propaganda file

update the readme with real XP instructions
does volume matter?

note ffmpeg if it also works

ffmpeg "executable" for recording et al [?]

== meh ==
can "convert" audio files :) [vlc?]

audio timestamps should "be monotonous" as long as there's no discontinuity (todo: understand discontinuity better first)

higher quality, like more than 2 track [possible?]

generate the right amount of silence: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6362458/generating-silent-audio-track we might be ok here tho...

test if I actually need threads or not...if not...why...remove them :)

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
are there tricks to avoid more discontinuity?

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: volume "doesn't" matter...
