link to screen capture once that can capture audio (so I don't have to do start/stop here)

== meh ==


figure out a way to stream to say ps3: http://superuser.com/questions/44629/application-to-stream-any-audio-to-upnp-device-xbox-360

have a "real" webpage for it so I can track analytics
do the propaganda file
  also propaganda something like "record what you hear program" or whatever to compete with freecorder and the like

can "convert" any audio file to a media player friendly mp3 :)

higher quality, like more than 2 tracks/44Khz [possible?]

test if I actually need threads or not...if not...why...remove them :)

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
are there tricks to avoid more discontinuity? code? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd370858(v=VS.85).aspx ?

real ddk thing [if anybody asks for it]

== notes ==

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: volume "doesn't" matter...
