double check...if it's not threaded, do I have more discontinuity messages on it?

fix the timestamps because...we can [?] I think that would be better...maybe...under normal cases...
  audio timestamps should "be monotonous" as long as there's no discontinuity (todo: understand discontinuity better first)

ffmpeg "executable" for recording et al [?]
  +- start, stop buttons I guess...

add an executable for "feedback" to check it's working...

== meh ==
propaganda file
can "convert" audio files :)

higher quality, like more than 2 track [possible?]

test if I actually need threads or not...if not...why...remove them :)

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
are there tricks to avoid more discontinuity? code? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd370858(v=VS.85).aspx ?

real ddk thing

== notes ==

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: volume "doesn't" matter...
