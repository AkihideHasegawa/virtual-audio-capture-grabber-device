== actually do==

application specific recordings

== meh ==

maybe something like VAC's usefulness for gamers? 

try "mixing" of several? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537517%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

start/stop buttons
  just leach
figure out a way to stream to say ps3: http://superuser.com/questions/44629/application-to-stream-any-audio-to-upnp-device-xbox-360
  have an "easy streamer" option
    or just have screen capture so it can stream, too :P
have a "real" webpage for it so I can track analytics
do the propaganda file
  also propaganda something like "record what you hear program" or whatever to compete with freecorder and the like

can "convert" any audio file to an media player friendlier mp3 :)

higher quality, like more than 2 tracks/44Khz [possible?]

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
real ddk thing [if anybody asks for it]

== notes ==

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: output setting volume "doesn't" matter...
