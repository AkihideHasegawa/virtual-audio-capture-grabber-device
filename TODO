== actually do==
  a "real" kernel level receive from driver

  new name?
    new web page/real web page
  

== maybe ==

  simpler/easier "just audio straight" recorder...

== meh/never ==

some thing that shows the current "bars" of how much it could/would be capturing...

figure out/debug pauses in FME when clicking "stop"...huh?

faster script startup speeds?

One feature I had thought of would be a "strip trailing silence" option or the like.  I know if I were recording things I might like it :)
Another option that might be useful/interesting might be to record/merge several audio input streams at a time.  This might be useful for recording skype calls so you can get the microphone as well as the "audio out".

  copy broadcaster here I guess?

  fix "everybody's bug"
      sleep 0's?
      reproduce?
      timestamps offset with a maximum end time?
     max(should, real) etc.!
      maybe it's fixed/ok? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd407208(v=vs.85).aspx

	  maybe something like VAC's usefulness for gamers or something? 

try "mixing" of several? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537517%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
  
system tray "start" "stop"

figure out a way to stream to say ps3: http://superuser.com/questions/44629/application-to-stream-any-audio-to-upnp-device-xbox-360
  have an "easy streamer" option
    or just have screen capture so it can stream, too :P
    
have a "real" webpage for it so I can track analytics/adsense

do the propaganda file
  also propaganda something like "record what you hear program" or whatever to compete with freecorder and the like

can "convert" any audio file to an media player friendlier mp3 :)

higher quality, like more than 2 tracks/44Khz [possible?]

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
real ddk thing [if anybody asks for it]

== notes ==

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: output setting volume "doesn't" matter...
