== actually do==


== meh ==
ffmpeg +- start, stop buttons I guess...
  just leach
have a "real" webpage for it so I can track analytics
propaganda file
can "convert" audio files :)

higher quality, like more than 2 track [possible?]

work when paused (esp. VLC)...hmm...do we need a realtime option? single-threaded m/b?
  actually...in this instance shouldn't I be calculating my own timestamps, starting from when I first got non discontinuous data? hmm...
   pass in the current ref time...hmm...or maybe if the buffer is too large I arbitrarily dump some of it?  I don't accomodate VLC pause but 
   maybe I'm ok realtime still, as is currently?  
  
real ddk thing [never]

== notes ==

note: the silence thing I think works...based on not hitting that line...
note: output setting volume "doesn't" matter...
