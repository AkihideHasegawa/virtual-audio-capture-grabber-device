TODO:
msvad:



notes:
big buffer: blips 2, 3
a little "fast forward snip" at the beginning when it's catching up (and has tons of blips)...

with threads 1, full size:
  a few fast forwards...


with threads 2:
lots of fast forward blips at the beginning, blips through, "stumbles forward"

with threads 2, actually using it, still just 2 blips
I think it's ok to use.
