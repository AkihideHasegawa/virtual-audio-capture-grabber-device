See http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/08/open-source-audio-sniffergrabber-for-windows-7vista for description.

Basically, it's an audio capture device for all "wave out sound" that is playing on your speakers (record what you hear).
It works for windows 7/Vista, which come without a default one for most soundcards, for some reason.


To install, as an administrator go to the Release subdir, and run
C:\...\Release> regsvr32 acam.ax

To uninstall:

C:\...\Release> regsvr32 /u acam.ax

ping me if you want installation made easier.

Then you can use it in VLC or whatever directshow compatible player/recorder you have as an input device.
