See http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/08/open-source-audio-sniffergrabber-for-windows-7vista for description.

To install, as an administrator go to the Release subdir, and run
C:\...\Release> regsvr32 acam.ax

To uninstall:

C:\...\Release> regsvr32 /u acam.ax

ping me if you want installation made easier.

Then you can use it in VLC or whatever directshow compatible player/recorder you have as an input device.
