See http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/08/open-source-audio-sniffergrabber-for-windows-7vista for description.

Basically, it's an audio capture device for all "wave out sound" that is playing on your speakers (record what you hear).
It works for windows 7/Vista, which comes without a default capture for most soundcards, it seems.

To install, as an administrator go to the Release subdirectory, and run
C:\...source_code\acam\Release> regsvr32 audio_sniffer.ax

To uninstall:

C:\...source_code\acam\Release> regsvr32 /u audio_sniffer.ax

ping me if you want this installation made easier :)

Then you can then use it in VLC or whatever directshow compatible player/recorder you have as a new input device.

If you use it in VLC you'll need a directshow cache of at least 40ms, for some odd reason.
