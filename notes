  Changing back to High Performance Power Plan is a workaround to fix it, but consumes a lot more energy and produces more heat.

resulted in this message very fast:

threaded:

with 5 other threads, dual core, they both seem to start giving bad feedback, possibly single threaded with smaller sizes [?]

seemed that it avoided discontinuity messages even if "lots" of them were running at once [!]
  unless one had to pause to delete a file, then it could get it.
