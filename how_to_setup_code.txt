basically install windows sdk 7.1 and visual studio express 2010 (a pain on windows 10)
then build directshow baseclasses from the SDK.
then open the visual studio project files in /source_code/acam
It outputs a .dll file that you "register" via (in administrator console) 
$ regsvr32 XXX.dll (and unregister when you're done with regsvr32 /u XXX.dll)

git submodule update --init --recursive

In essence this is the "WASAPI loopback" sample
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/matthew_van_eerde/2008/12/16/sample-wasapi-loopback-capture-record-what-you-hear/

combined with the "capture source filter" http://tmhare.mvps.org/downloads.htm but with many improvements :)

So go to those two to learn the basics.

This is meant to provide a "directshow filter" you can use in your graph, not a demo of how to do graphs.
