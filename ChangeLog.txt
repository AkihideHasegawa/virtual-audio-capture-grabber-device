0.3.8

5.1 support now. If you have an ASUS Xonar card you may need to "disable gx" (the little gx green-light-button in the xonar control dock).

0.3.7

make compatible with FMLE now [hopefully], minor cleanups, but FMLE still "freezes" a lot I'm not sure why.

0.3.6

hopefully fix ffmpeg complaining like:

[libmp3lame @ 00670aa0] Que input is backward in time
Audio timestamp 329016 < 329026 invalid, cliping00:05:29.05 bitrate= 738.6kbits/s
[libmp3lame @ 00670aa0] Que input is backward in time


0.3.5

bug fixes in recording

0.3.4

can also record to ac3/video now
includes the 64 bit device now, too.

0.3.3 

cleaner recorder, add broadcast links, allow xp users to install it, device didn't change at all

0.3.2 

 fix for 64 bit windows, fix button recording

0.3.1

new program icons, new record option

0.3.0

Fix output for 48000 Hz etc. Sweet!

0.2.10 

Fix installer.

0.2.9 5/8/12

  move an assertion, also we use a more "directshowy" fillbuffer now, which...is probably wrong but hey :P
  more debug logs

0.2.8 2-21-12
  64 bit release kind of

0.2.7 1-5-12
  some minor directshow stuff has been updated, I believe

0.2.6
  some stuff from earlier, like adding bigger buffers and setting it to the graph's timestamp.

0.2.3: better timestamps barely

0.2.2: rename program files icon, new README

0.2.1: slightly better gui

0.2.0: make the capture thread realtime priority (better performance), add some record scripts, make timestamps match up now [I think this is right]
